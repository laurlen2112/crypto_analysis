# Module 18: Crypto Analysis

## Overview:

This challenge uses unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis to assist clients desiring to enter the cryptocurrency market.  The [underlying code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/crypto_analysis/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) is created in jupyter notebook.  It utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, SKlearn, and HoloViews to clean, process, and visualize the data.

Once the data is cleaned and processed, it can be visualized in various forms including both 3-D and 2-D visualizations.
