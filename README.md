# Module 18: Crypto Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of this challenge is to use unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis that assists clients desiring to enter the cryptocurrecy market.  The [underlying code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/crypto_analysis/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) is created in jupyter notebook.  It utilizes varias libraries such as pandas, sklearn, and holoviews to clean and process the data.

Once the data is cleaned and processed, it can be visulized in various forms including both 3-D and 2-D visulazations.

The above plots are interactive. The view is altered using the toolbar highlighted in yellow in the example above.  Additionally, hovering over datapoints provides information about the data.
